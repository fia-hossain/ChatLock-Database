Act 1, Scene 3:
JULIET
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

JULIET
It is an honour that I dream not of.

JULIET
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

Act 1, Scene 5:
(After meeting Romeo)

JULIET
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

JULIET
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

JULIET
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

JULIET
You kiss by the book.

JULIET
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

JULIET
What's he that now is going out of door?

JULIET
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

JULIET
If he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

JULIET
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
